# GCP_Project
My attempt at a full stack data science project. This will ideally get updated as the project moves along but I'm having some issues that I would need to resolve in the google shell environment, part of what I'm trying to do to get around it is hard coding some sensitive information in the code (project-id, bucket, google cloud access code I believe) which makes me hesistant to share some of the code. It's bad for a project that gets put into production I'm sure but I want to get something up and running and then clean it up. Will ask for help and see what happens. I have code for the other things in my resume but I'd need to see why it's not coming out ideal in conjuction with the other stuff before I push it here

This is the dataflow job (programmed with apache beam, a package in python) that takes in data and transforms it into something that a machine learning algorithm likes.
